# Project Implemetation

### Model Algorithm

This project implements a Value Based method called Deep Q-Network (DQN). 
The DQN architecture is composed of a couple of convolutional layers, followed by a couple of fully connected layers. 
The DQN takes the state  of the environment as input, and returns the corresponding predicted action values for each possible actions available.
This learning algorithm utilized the 2 major training improvements to the DQN algorithm: Experience Replay and Fixed Q Targets.
